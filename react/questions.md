<details><summary>What is an SPA (single page application), and what are the benefits of using it?</summary>
In an SPA, some of the website content stays the same no matter where you navigate to (e.g. Header, footer, company logo etc). When you change to another subpage, the server will only send the parts of the website that are different.
This improves user experience due to faster load times and decreases server load and bandwidth usage.
