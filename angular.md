# Hello World
create a new angluar project by running
```
ng new helloworld
```
Now you can start the default angular project by running 
```
cd helloworld; ng serve
```
pressing o+enter will open the project in your default browser. It should say something like `Congratulations! Your app is running. `
# File structure
When creating the hello world project, ng creates a directory (in this case called helloworld). This directory contains a bunch of files. We will mainly focus on the src-subdirectory. Here, we find main.ts, where the execution starts. 

in app.components.ts, you can change the title. Try it!
